Thicket: A Decentralized Vine Clone
===================================

Vine was a short-form video hosting service where users could share
six-second-long looping video clips. You can think of it as the "Instagram for
GIFs."

Thicket is (or will be) a service that utilizes **Offline First** and
**Distributed Web** technologies to realize the same functionality without any
intermediary servers. It is (or will be) Vine the app without Vine the company.

If the necessary networks and protocols are mature enough, we will be able to
build an entire proof-of-concept social network that stores all of its data
within its users' browsers, requiring no centralized servers for data storage.

Content created in the app is (or will be) shareable to the traditional web.


Design Goals
============

1. Build an app that runs in the browser, and requires no downloads
2. Store all data locally, on users' individual machines
3. Broadcast data directly from one user to another, with no servers
   intermediating


This Is Research
================

This is being created by [Citrusbyte] as a research project under the
Citrusbyte Labs umbrella.

Accordingly, our design goals are oriented toward a research project. We do not
expect all of our design goals to result in an app that is fully usable for
end-users. Specifically, storing all data within users' browsers does not seem
scalable.

Long-term, there are ways to work around this problem—we could offer users the
opportunity to back up their own data on a device plugged into their home
router, or we could allow them to pay other people to store their data on the
IPFS network using Filecoin. But those sorts of long-term solutions aren't
ready yet, and are outside the scope of our research.

Our main research effort will last 6 to 8 weeks. You can follow along with this
effort on [our Project board](https://github.com/citrusbyte/thicket/projects/2).

What is Citrusbyte Labs?
========================

[Citrusbyte] is a thought-leader in both software engineering and design.
Citrusbyte Labs is an internal initiative to hold ourselves to that, and how we
demonstrate it to the world. This has many benefits:

1. **Attract customers**: Citrusbyte Labs attracts customers in two ways.
   First, there are customers who don’t know exactly what technology they want
   to use. For these customers, Labs will set Citrusbyte ahead of our
   competitors, and convince them to trust us with their projects. Second,
   there are customers who do have an idea of specific technologies they want
   to use. These customers may find Citrusbyte by searching the web for
   consultancies proficient in their preferred technology, and Labs will funnel
   them to our sales page.
2. **Attract talent**: High-skill engineers and designers want to work with
   companies that don’t merely list various technologies on job postings, but
   who demonstrate industry leadership in those technologies.
3. **Retain talent**: Citrusbyte Labs will provide a framework for engineers
   and designers at Citrusbyte to cycle out of client work and spend time
   focused on exploration and skill growth. This provides an outlet for
   creative expression, career advancement, and self-actualization, which means
   engineers and designers don’t need to leave Citrusbyte to find such
   opportunities.
4. **Self-fulfilling prophecies**: If someone at Citrusbyte wishes we did more
   client work with Technology X, we increase our chances of obtaining such
   contracts by building up in-house expertise in Technology X and
   demonstrating this expertise.
5. **Spin-off products**: some experiments done under the umbrella of
   Citrusbyte Labs may become products. Such products may prove to have
   business models which could generate recurring revenue for Citrusbyte; such
   revenue can continue even when client work runs thin.
6. **Give back**: Citrusbyte has greatly benefited from the open culture of the
   software industry. By continuing this proud tradition, we do our part to
   ensure the continuation of this open culture. We also pay off a small part
   of the great debt we owe to everyone else who have shared their expertise
   and libraries with us.
7. **World improvement**: Citrusbyte Labs provides people within our company
   opportunities to explore world-improving ideas which may not have immediate
   economic justification.
