Thicket: A Decentralized Vine Clone
===================================

Vine was a short-form video hosting service where users could share
six-second-long looping video clips. You can think of it as the "Instagram for
GIFs."

Thicket is (or will be) a service that utilizes **Offline First** and
**Distributed Web** technologies to realize the same functionality without any
intermediary servers. It is (or will be) Vine the app without Vine the company.

If the necessary networks and protocols are mature enough, we will be able to
build an entire proof-of-concept social network that stores all of its data
within its users' devices, requiring no centralized servers for data storage.

Content created in the app is (or will be) shareable to the traditional web.


Ideal App
=========

If we built the app to "completion" (insofar as any app is ever complete), it
would have the following:

1. Progressive Web App, usable from desktop or mobile browsers, savable to device home screen
2. Creation of GIFs using device camera and JavaScript
3. Creation of personal feed of own created content
4. Serving content: replicating content across devices without central servers
5. Sharing content to traditional web
6. User authentication
7. Social interaction: users following other users
